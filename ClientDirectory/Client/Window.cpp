        The numbers that I decided on for LengthOfOpposite and HightOfOpposite is based on these measurements
        When I could see the edges of a 32 inch wide door while not moving my eyes I was 2.5 inches away
        LengthOfOpposite : 
            The default FOV is 100 and we only want one half of the opposite
            This lead me to the equation (100 / ? = 16)
            And the calculation is FOV / 6.25 = (opposite) / 2 
        HightOfOpposite : 
            The moniters aspect ratio is used to find HightOfOpposite
            We can get the LengthOfOpposite with the equation above
            With that we devide by the length and then multiply by the hight
            This gets us the scaled to the moniter result

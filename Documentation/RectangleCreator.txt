The numbers that I decided on for LengthOfOpposite and HightOfOpposite is based on these measurements
    When I could see the edges of a 32 inch wide door while not moving my eyes I was 2.5 inches away
    LengthOfOpposite : 
        The default FOV is 100 and we only want one half of the opposite
        This lead me to the equation (100 / ? = 16)
        And the calculation is FOV / 6.25 = (opposite) / 2 
    HightOfOpposite : 
        The moniters aspect ratio is used to find HightOfOpposite
        We can get the LengthOfOpposite with the equation above
        With that we devide by the length and then multiply by the hight
        This gets us the scaled to the moniter result

        C = Camera
        1 = (x, y, z) = (+, +, -) = (+2.5, +HightOfOpposite, -LengthOfOpposite)
        2 = (x, y, z) = (+, +, +) = (+2.5, +HightOfOpposite, +LengthOfOpposite)
        3 = (x, y, z) = (+, -, -) = (+2.5, -HightOfOpposite, -LengthOfOpposite)
        4 = (x, y, z) = (+, -, +) = (+2.5, -HightOfOpposite, +LengthOfOpposite)
